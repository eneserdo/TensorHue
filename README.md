# 🐊 Modergator - Hate Detection for Text, Speech and Memes

Modergator is a Telegram bot able to moderate Telegram groups for hateful content.

Text messages are checked for whether they contain offensive and hateful speech, as well as the target groups that the speech is directed against (if there are any). Voice messages are transcribed and then handled the same way as text messages.

Memes are checked for hate which arises due to the combination of text and image.

**Currently, the bot can only understand the English language.**
